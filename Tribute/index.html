        Hedy Lamarr was a remarkable Austrian-American actress and inventor born in 1914. She gained fame as a Hollywood
        star in the 1930s and 1940s, known for her beauty and acting talent. However, her legacy extends beyond the
        silver screen. Lamarr co-invented a groundbreaking frequency-hopping spread spectrum communication system during
        World War II, which laid the foundation for modern wireless technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Her
        contributions to both entertainment and technology have left an enduring impact, earning her recognition as a
        pioneer in both fields.

      <h2>Her Biography</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="biographyText">
      Hedy Lamarr was an Austrian-American actress and inventor who pioneered the technology that would one day form the
      basis for today’s WiFi, GPS, and Bluetooth communication systems. As a natural beauty seen widely on the big
      screen in films like Samson and Delilah and White Cargo, society has long ignored her inventive genius. <br> <br>

      Lamarr was originally Hedwig Eva Kiesler, born in Vienna, Austria on November 9th, 1914 into a well-to-do Jewish
      family. An only child, Lamarr received a great deal of attention from her father, a bank director and curious man,
      who inspired her to look at the world with open eyes. He would often take her for long walks where he would
      discuss the inner-workings of different machines, like the printing press or street cars. These conversations
      guided Lamarr’s thinking and at only 5 years of age, she could be found taking apart and reassembling her music
      box to understand how the machine operated. Meanwhile, Lamarr’s mother was a concert pianist and introduced her to
      the arts, placing her in both ballet and piano lessons from a young age. <br> <br>

      Lamarr’s brilliant mind was ignored, and her beauty took center stage when she was discovered by director Max
      Reinhardt at age 16. She studied acting with Reinhardt in Berlin and was in her first small film role by 1930, in
      a German film called Geld auf der Straβe (“Money on the Street”). However, it wasn’t until 1932 that Lamarr gained
      name recognition as an actress for her role in the controversial film, Ecstasy. <br> <br>
